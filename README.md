# bowling_kata
A project to solve the bowling kata from CodingDojo

## How to use
The bowling score class can calculate the score for either a few turns or a full match. When initialized it needs a string of characters, each representing a throw of the ball, for example `X9/` which would be a strike, a 9 and a spare.

It also has an optional second parameter, which should be set to true if calculating the score for a full match.

See the example.rb file to see some examples of how it can be used.
